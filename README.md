# NYC-Yellow-Taxi-Spark-Streaming

As much as New York City is renowned for its cosmopolitan population and financial district, it is equally renowned for its taxi system and traffic! For our project we dive deep into this very source by analyzing the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commissions (TLC) data for helping the users analyze the fare prices and many other details based on different geographical, temporal, financial and service oriented factors.

It is a necessity to employ Machine learning techniques to develop efficient fare predictions for as complex a system as the New York City Taxi services. With the rapidly growing demand for app owned as well as fleet taxis, we thought that it would be interesting to dig deeper into the factors affecting these services and improve it for the growing user need. The demand for taxi services increased by 300\% between 2018 to 2021. That means there are more cars, more drivers, and more mobility. We are only aware of the true extent of this transformation because of the massive data collected by the New York City TLC. We performed a three year (2021, 2020, 2019) trend analysis for the data accumulated from NYC TLC website amounting to over 65,092,557 records of 5.8866 GigaBytes size.
